## Conclusions

- The model doesn't present a very good fit and the error rates are significantly high.
- The date currently was extracted for a single point along the Snake River in Idaho falls. This needs to change and we would need to sample the data for an entire region as well as take a distance-based average of the data along that region. 
- We probably need to switch to a daily timestep since the monthly data we have is not enough for most models to effectively create a pattern.  
- Once a model has been trained for a region, we need to evaluate it with actual live data from the LDAS system.
